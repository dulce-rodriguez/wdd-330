    <h1>Week 8 Notes</h1>
   <h3>Transforms</h3>
   <p>This property lets us translate, rotate,
       scale, any element on the page.
   </p>
   <h4>Translation</h4>
   <p>This moves an element left, right, up or down.
   <br>Similar to the behavior of position: relative; when declaring top 
   and left.
   the translate(x,y) function moves an element x from the left, and y from the top.
</p>
  <h4>Scaling</h4>
  <p>The scale(x,y) function scales an element by the defined factors 
      horizontally then vertically.</p>
  <h4>Rotation</h4>
  <p>This function rotates an element around the point of origin by a specified 
      angle value. As with scale, by default the point of origin is the 
      elements center. </p>
  <h4>Changing the Origin of the Transform</h4>
  <p>his is done using the transform-origin property. It has the same 
      syntax as the background-position property, and defaults to the 
      center of the object (so that scales and rotations will be around 
      the center of the box by default).</p>
    <h3>Transitions</h3>
    <p>Transitions allow the values of CSS properties to change over time, 
        essentially providing simple animations.<br>
        <b>Transition-property:</b> defines the CSS properties of the 
        element that should be transitioned, with all for all properties 
        being the default.<br>
        <b>transition-duration:</b> sets how long the transition will take:
         the duration of time it takes to go from the default state to the 
         transitioned state. <br>
        <b>transition-timing-function</b>  lets you control the pace of the 
        transition in even more granular detail.<br>
        <b>transition-delay</b> , itâ€™s possible to introduce a delay before 
        the transition begins. Normally a transition begins immediately, 
        so the default is 0. Include the number of milliseconds (ms) or 
        seconds (s) to delay the transition.
     </p>
    <h3>Canvas</h3>
    <p>we can draw shapes and lines, arcs and text, gradients and patterns. 
        In addition, canvas gives us the power to manipulate pixels in 
        images and even video. </p>
    <h3>SVG</h3>
    <p>SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics, a specific file format 
        that allows you to describe vector graphics using XML. We can 
        use SVG to do many of the same tasks we can do with canvas, 
        including drawing paths, shapes, text, gradients, and patterns.</p>
    <h3>Drag & Drop</h3>
    <p>This API allows us to specify that certain elements are draggable, 
        and then specify what should happen when these draggable elements 
        are dragged over or dropped onto other elements on the page.</p>
