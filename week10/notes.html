    <h3>Form Validation</h3>
    <p>Find an example of form validation below in which the form will not go through unless a name is written</p>
    <form name="myForm" action="/action_page.php" onsubmit="return validateForm()" method="post">
        Name: <input type="text" name="fname">
        <input type="submit" value="Submit">
      </form>

    <h3>Fetch</h3>
    <p>It passes a url as the first property, and it has 
        a second property which is optional 
    </p>
    <p>The Promise returned from fetch() won't reject on 
        HTTP error status even if the response is an HTTP 
        404 or 500. Instead, as soon as the server responds
         with headers, the Promise will resolve normally, 
         and it will only reject on network failure or if 
         anything prevented the request from completing.</p>
    <h3>Supplying request options</h3>     
    <p>The fetch() method can optionally accept a second parameter, 
        an init object that allows you to control different settings</p>
    <h3>Sending a request with credentials included</h3>     
    <p>Add credentials: 'include' to the init object you pass to the fetch() method.</p>
    <h3>Uploading a file</h3>     
    <p>Files can be uploaded using an HTML <input type="file" /> input element, FormData() and fetch().</p>
    <h3>Uploading multiple files</h3>     
    <p>Files can be uploaded using an HTML <input type="file" multiple /> input element, FormData() and fetch().</p>
    <h3>Checking that the fetch was successful</h3>     
    <p>A fetch() promise will reject with a TypeError when a network 
        error is encountered or CORS is misconfigured on the server-side,
         although this usually means permission issues or similar â€” a 404
          does not constitute a network error, for example.</p>
    <h3>Headers</h3>     
    <p>The Headers interface allows you to create your own headers
         object via the Headers() constructor. </p>
    <h3>Body</h3>     
    <p>The Request and Response interfaces share the following 
        methods to extract a body. These all return a promise that 
        is eventually resolved with the actual content. </p>
