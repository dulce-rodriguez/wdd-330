    <h1>Week 3 Notes</h1>
    <h3>Objects</h3>
    <p>An object in JavaScript is a self-contained set
         of related values and functions. They act as a collection 
         of named properties that map to any JavaScript value such as strings, 
         numbers, booleans, arrays and functions. If a propertyâ€™s value is a function, 
         it is known as a method.</p>
         <p>We add all the content within "{}" and to locate them, we use a "."<br>
        For example: pets.name</p>
        <p>The Object.keys() method will return an array of all the keys of any object
             that is provided as an argument. </p>
        <p> Object.values() that works in the same way, but returns an array 
            of all the object's value</p>
        <p>Object.entries() returns an array of key-value pairs.</p>
    <h3>DOM</h3>
    <p>It helps us to access any document in HTML. For this we use
        document.getelementbyid("nameofdocument")<br>
        We can also assign variable to it so it will display what the label we are 
        looking for. <br>
        innerHTML finds the content within the label<br><br>
        Separated by dots, we can even change the style of the tags 
        that we have in our document.<br><br>
        Making changes through the DOM makes it easier.
    </p>
    <h3>Events</h3>
    <p>Events help us know when something happen in our website. <br>
        Here's an example of an event:</p>
    <div>
        <button id="button" class="test-button">Change</button>
    </div>
    <script>
        let button = document.getElementById("button");

        button.addEventListener('click', function(){
            console.log("you have clicked me");
        })
        button.addEventListener('mouseover', function(){
            console.log("I've detected your mouse");
        })
        button.addEventListener('mouseout', function(){
            console.log("Goodbye mouse");
        })
    </script>
</body>
