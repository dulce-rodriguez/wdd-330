    <h1>Week 7 Notes</h1>
    <h2>Further functions</h2>
    <h3>Call and apply methods</h3>
    <p>The call method can be used to set the value of this in a function.<br>
    The apply method is similar, except the arguments are provided as an array.</p>
    <h3>Memoization</h3>
    <p>Another word for cache</p>
    <h3>Immediately invoked function expressions</h3>
    <p>Is invoked as soon as it is defined. We just need to put parentheses
        at the end of the functon definition. And the whole declaration is also
        placed inside parentheses.
    </p>
    <h3>Functions that define and rewrite themselves</h3>
    <p>This is done by assigning an anonymous function to a variable that has 
        the same name as the function.</p>
    <h3>Recursive Functions</h3>    
    <p>It invokes itself until a certain condition is met</p>
    <h3>Callbacks</h3>
    <p><b>Note to remember:</b> Remember that JavaScript is still single-threaded, 
        so only one task can happen at once.</p>
    <h3>Promises, and how to create them</h3>
    <p>They do the same thing as callbacks.<br>
    They are created using a constructor function. This takes a function called 
    an executor as an argument. The executor initializes the promise and starts 
    the asynchronous operation.</p>
    <h3>Closures</h3>
    <p>is a reference to a variable that was created inside the scope of another 
    function, but is then kept alive and used in another part of the program.<br>
    A closure is formed when a function returns another function that then 
    maintains access to any variables created in the original functionâ€™s scope. </p>
    <h3>Functional Programming</h3>
    <p>Functional programming uses pure functions as the building blocks of a 
        program. The functions perform a series of operations without changing 
        the state of any data. Each function forms an abstraction that should 
        perform a single task, while encapsulating the details of its implementation 
        inside the body of the function.</p>
    <h2>AJAX</h2>
    <p>As far as I understood, AJAX helps us load some piece of information
        from the server, using JSON into the web browser.
